# signal-processing-with-Python-for-Neuroscience
**Course Overview**
The "Signal Processing in Python for EEG" course is designed to teach you how to process and analyze electroencephalography (EEG) data using Python. Throughout the repo, you can learn:

-Fundamentals of EEG and signal processing
-How to load, preprocess, and visualize EEG data
-Techniques for filtering, artifact removal, and feature extraction
-Application of machine learning for EEG data analysis
-Real-world examples and case studies

**Repository Contents**
This repository includes the following:
1-Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the concepts and techniques covered in the course, as well as additional notebooks for:
  .Visualizing data (3.Visualisation.ipynb)
  .Implementing band-pass filtering (4.Band_Pass_Filter.ipynb)
  .Applying smoothing filters (5.Smoothing_filters.ipynb)
  .Performing frequency analysis (6.Frequency_analysis.ipynb)
  .Removing muscle artifacts and performing component extraction (7.Remove+muscle+artefacts+and+component+extraction.ipynb)
  .Implementing real-time band-pass filtering (8.Band-pass+in+real-time.ipynb)
  .Practical implementation of the techniques (9.Practical_implementation.ipynb)
2-Data: Sample EEG datasets used throughout the course and in the additional notebooks.
Scripts: Python scripts for specific signal processing tasks.
Utilities: Helper functions and modules for common EEG data manipulation
